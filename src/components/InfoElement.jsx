        <p>
          This program is a javascripr implementation of "boids" algorithm. The
          movement of particles on the screen is called flocking. Flocking is
          typical for the movement of a big group of birds, fish, or insects.

        <h3>How?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Every particle on the screen tries to have the same direction of
            movement as other nearby particles.
          </li>
          <li>Particles are atracted together.</li>
          <li>
            Particles also repel each other (proportional to one over distance)
          </li>
